Public Policy - Applied Science - Application of Economics

## Public Policy Analysis
1. Understand what state does, and how it affects us 
2. To access a state policy against some parameters (eg. it's goals) 
3. To place a state action in context (historical, geographic, economic, demographic, political, geopolitical, legal, cultural...)

# Analysis - Understand, Predict, Control

# Tools
## Theories and Hypothesis
- Proposed relationship btw two variables
- Hypothesis is a proto theory 
- Analysis that do not make theoretical claim is *analysis*
## Model
Attempt to replicate an existing or imagined system or some part of the system in order to understand it better 
- The map is not the territory - Ceteris Paribus vs All things Considered
- A model need not exist in reality for it to be useful 
- Limitations vs Criticism 
## Data
A variable
Can be real (observed / empirical) or synthetic (inferred / estimated / assumed)

# Meet the policymakers
## Mental Model
What I *have* to do, *can* do, *can not* do, what is my *interest* in it?
## Power and Constraints are Structural
Article 12 - Definition of State 
Article 13 - laws inconsistent with Fundamental Rights
7th Schedule - Union and States 
11th & 12th Schedule - Power and responsibilities of local government 
## Interest
Policymakers have self interest 
Public interest and self interest may or may not allign

## Evidence
- Evidence takes time
	# Policy - System & Institutions = People
- Complex adaptive systems
- Homeostatis
- Critical Range Theory
- Institutions Maintain Critical Ranges
- Institutions are the reservoir of society's homeostatic stamina
- Institutions are the stewards of human society
- Systems and Institutions are not automatons


# Ten Takeaways
1. we live inside policy system
2. we understand by analysing its parts and their interaction 
3. Context matters
4. History Matters
5. Power Matters
6. Analysts love data - and seldom get data they want
7. We are all biased
8. Time matters
9. Institutions Matter
10. Dont give up

8. Change / Reassign ownership 

# Allison & Zelikow's 3(+1) model
1. Optimise
2. Satisfice
3. Negotiate

Two level games
Zone of possible aggreement
hidden equilibrium / double win set
tied hands
transgovernmentalism
