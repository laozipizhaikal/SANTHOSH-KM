"Where the free market fails to deliver efficient economic outcomes, this is termed **[[All Notes/market failure|market failure]]**'. Market failures come in four kinds:
- [[All Notes/Externalities|Externalities]],
- [[All Notes/Asymmetric information|Asymmetric information]],
- [[All Notes/Market power|Market power]] and
- [[All Notes/Public goods|Public goods]]

The essence of market failure is the channels of influence between two persons which are not governed by negotiations and choice: 
- **Market power**: One party in the negotiation has little power and experiences a loss of choice.
- **Asymmetric information**: The process of negotiation works poorly as there is a lack of information.
- **Externalities**: There are channels of influence between two parties that are not negotiated.
- **Public goods**: The individual is not given the opportunity to negotiate and choose.‚Äù
