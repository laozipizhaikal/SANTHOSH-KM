Subconsciously we are reading aloud in our head 
Words are sound 
All writing is music
When u read u are focused on the meaning and the music of the words is background music
if the music is discordant or jangly, the reader will walk away

‘Penta’ means five, so pentameter simply means five meters. A line of poetry written in iambic pentameter has five feet = five sets of stressed syllables and unstressed syllables.

 Putting these two terms together, iambic pentameter is a line of writing that consists of ten syllables in a specific pattern of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable, or a short syllable followed by a long syllable.
