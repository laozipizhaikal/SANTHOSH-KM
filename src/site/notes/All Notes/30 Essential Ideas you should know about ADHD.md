# 1. Developmental Disorder - failure to develop
 Chronic delay in developmental traits - quantitative differences 
## 1.1 Inhibition
not suppressing irrelevant behaviour 
cognitive impulsiveness 
symptom - restlessness - gross motor activity and cognitive restlessness - internal restlessness 
affects emotions - **emotional impulsiveness** - not a mood disorder - 
mood disorder - generating too much emotion 
ADHD - display emotions quickly -  failure to regulate normal emotions - self regulation issues - to self sooth to self calm - quickness to emote 
modify the emotion to be more socially acceptable less damaging 
inability to manage frustration impatience and anger 
## 1.2 inability to make close friendships 
and relationships 

# 2. Failing to develop on schedule
##  2.1 Persistence
nature of inattentiveness is unique - failure of **persistence**
motor part of brain 
behaviour motivation future
	can you sustain action towards a goal adequately to achieve it  

	failure to direct behaviour foreward in time 
	can not presist towards these delayed end points in life

## 2.2 Resist distraction 
distraction provoke a response and the response can not be inhibited 
ability to reengage - *working memory disorder* 
 executive deficits 
**developmental disorder of self regulation**
 inhibit your behavour and direct your action towards
 thinking - self directed activity 












1A: Introduction, Chronic Developmental Disability  Know the disorder o Developmental disability is an age inappropriate behavior, delay in the rate of a normal development o ADHD is different than normal in a quantitative way, not a qualitative way. o A chronic lag in the traits o The degree of the delay is the distinction of ADHD. o It is not a different state of humanity, but a better or worse at a specific trait.  Two types psychological traits not developing 1B: Inhibition, Impulsivity & Emotions  What is delayed? o Inhibition: First sign is typically hyperactivity  Motor actions: verbal behavior and intrusive & disruptive motor/verbal  Cognitive decision on done without thinking first.  Restlessness  Declines with age (typically be adolescence)  Busyness of one’s mind o Emotional Impulsiveness  1798: First initial medical reference  Until 1976, emotion was apart of ADHD.  Quick display of emotions  Not a mood disorder (generation of too much emotion)  Self-regulation disorder, not increased generation of emotion  You can be impulsive in behavior without impulsiveness in the emotions  Emotion needs to go back into the study of ADHD  ADHD causes ODD o ODD Symptoms  Mood  Anger  Temper  Hostility  Annoyed  50-70% of ADHD children are rejected by close friends by the second grade. o Inability to create and make close friendships.  Emotion is the biggest conflict in marital relationships with a spouse that has ADHD 2ALL: Persistence, Sustaining action to a Goal  At least 6 or 7 different kinds of support networks in the brain  Nature of the inattentiveness helps bring clarity to a disorder

Persistence towards a goal  ADHD is not a problem of processing, but the motor part (front lobe) part of a brain  Working Memory Disorder  EDFD  We do loose memory, we loose working memory  ADHD: an ability to reach a goal because of the working memory is distracted  Executive Deficits  Developmental Disorder of Self-Regulation, not attention (SRDD, not ADHD)  Self-Regulation is for long term self improvement, not short term self improvement  ADHD children had delayed responses to consequences. 3A The Five Executive Functions  Self-Control is not learned, but it a neuro-genetic gift and who they are The 5 problems that are difficult with a child with ADHD 1. Can you stop/wait “Everything comes to those who wait.” In ADHD, there is not pause. Event then response, event then response. 2. Visualization: Mental/Visual past/ Hindsight & Foresight: Looking back to anticipate 3. Cannot talk to themselves a. The voice in our head to help control ourselves b. No minds voice 4. Mind’s Heart: Ability to manage their emotions so they are more social acceptable. a. More consistent with goals b. Our emotions are our motivations c. If we cannot manage our emotions, then we cannot manage our motivations. d. ADHD will always be dependent on their environment around them e. ADHD are unable to self motivate 5. Mind’s Playground a. Will not appear until late childhood b. Plan & Problem Solve  Each of these are located in the frontal lobe. 6ALL: How to manage & accommodate ADHD  5 things to do 1. Child cannot stop & hold things in mind: So do not make them o They need external forms of information o Substitution for working memory: sticky notes, cubes, graphs, lists, etc. 2. No internal clock

A timer o Breaking the future in the pieces, do not try to point to the further o ERO:  Events  Reponses  Outcomes 3. All motivation is external a. Something in for your if you are going to persist b. Thinking win/win 4. Mental Play a. Ability to manipulates the contents in your mind. b. Source of planning & problem solving difficultly c. Making mental information/ideas physical 5. ADHD rarely occurs alone a. Other disorders will more than likely come along your child’s lif
